Correction Statement:
Excuse me!
Due to the infamous ‘Monaco NoKiddingNapping’ (link to Publish0x post of this story)’ 
it is our duty to point out to you that the mentioning of the Term ‘MCO Card’ is no longer cutting edge. We kindly encourage you to take a deep breath, close your eyes, feel and think: rich, casino, and blue, and then loudly pronounce the Term: ˈ[mänəkō kärd]’, to familiarize yourself with the change.
If you are referencing it in writing please write: ‘*** Card’ to show that you are “in the know”.

View the poll and participate should you want to disagree/agree.
