# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal


Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** 
William Chadwick

**Project Name:** 
Monaco Reddit Bot

**Is your project New or Old?**
Old

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo

## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
This bot will use the PRAW to scan reddit pages 

It will search for instances of the phrase MCO Card, in reference to the credit cards offered by Crypto.com.

It will alert them to the original, and now unoffical, name of the card, and currency, as "Monaco".

It will instruct them, and encourage them to share with others, that the card ought to be referre to as a/the "Monaco Card", and the currency as Monaco (MCO)

## Challenges I Anticipate

**Getting shut down by reddit
**Getting posts removed by reddit
**

## Skateboard

**Use reddit API to find posts containing the phrase “MCO Card”, and save them to a list.**

## Bike
**Push to a production server and make it run** 

## Car
**Get bot to post stock response in thread to users who use the phrase, and not get blocked/removed by reddit bots and moderators, by slowing it down to human speeds** 

## Personal Achievement Goals:

### Teammate 1

1. Try building something I haven't tried before
1. Ship it to liver server and have it run
1. Have it successfully make the response posts it is designed to make
